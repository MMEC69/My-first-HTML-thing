            <p><p>According to the apexlegends.fandom.com Pathfinder, I'm Marvin, but my best friends 
                call me Pathfinder. I love being an Apex Legend because that means my banner is on 
                display for everyone in the Outlands to see, especially my creator whoever they are. 
                Competing alongside so many skilled fighters each match is really cool and it makes me 
                very excited to know that I am everyone’s favorite squadmate to fight with; my friend 
                Mirage told me that. 
                He also said that I don’t get sarcasm, which was also nice to hear...I think.</p></p>

        <h2>Pathfinder kill equip.</h2>
                <p>THere are many kill equips for path finder. the feels odly nicer
                    which means less threatning than other legends kill equips such as Revenant has more
                    threatning kill equip can provide chills.
