                <p style = "color:purple; text-align:justify; font-size:120%;">Each update comes with a new legend. 
                These updates are delivered as per season currently this game has about Thirteen (13) season.
                At the beginning of the game defeault legends were added, by the time now most of them have been nerfed but they are still OP.
                My faviourite one of them is known as path finder.</p>

                Path finder is unique legend which we will be discussed in the following topics. 
            </p>
            <h1 style = "font-size:99%">Who the hell is path finder?</h1>

            <h2 style = "font-size:15px;" >Is it human?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p title= 'About "mySelf"' style = "text-align:justify; font-size:120%;">Path finder is not a human nor even organic, he/it is a robot not even a synthetic or cuborg just a plain old simple robotwho has the capability of grappling
                from place to place. By this ability we can make cool shots as well as excap from combat whener necessary. But this has varible cool down time depending on the distance we used the grapple to travel it could be between 3s to 10s. 
                Ultimate ability allows this legend to create a cable line which doesnt not just pathfinder to cross
                other temamates also have the ability to travel by it by using he item placed by us. Even the enemies can use it. in my experience
                i havent noticed yet it could be destroyed so we can imaginge it as a static item created by a legend rather such items like
                ramaparts covers, newcastles shield like wise. you can cover up larger distances with this ultimate ability, the only risk is while we using it, it expose ourselves 
                to enemies which is not good in this game given that we can be easily tracked and taken Down. path finder usully says,
