                <p style = "color:purple; text-align:justify; font-size:120%;">Each update comes with a new legend. 
                These updates are delivered as per season currently this game has about Thirteen (13) season.
                At the beginning of the game defeault legends were added, by the time now most of them have been nerfed but they are still OP.
                My faviourite one of them is known as path finder.</p>

            <p title= 'About "mySelf"' style = "text-align:justify; font-size:120%;"><strong>Path finder </strong>is not a <b>human nor even organic</b>, he/it is a robot not even a 
                "synthetic" or <mark>cyborg </mark>just a plain old simple robot who has the capability of grappling
                from place to place. By this ability we can make cool shots as well as excap from combat whener necessary. But this has varible 
                cool down time depending on the distance we used the grapple to travel it could be between 3s to 10s. 
                Ultimate ability allows this <i>legend </i>to create a cable line which doesnt not just pathfinder to cross
                other temamates also have the ability to travel by it by using he item placed by us. Even the enemies can use it. in my experience
                i havent noticed yet it could be destroyed so we can imaginge it as a static item created by a legend rather such items like
                ramaparts covers, newcastles shield like wise.<br> 
                <q>you can cover up larger distances with this ultimate ability, the only risk is while we using it, it expose ourselves 
                to enemies which is not good in this game given that we can be easily tracked and taken Down. path finder usully says,

            <blockquote cite = "https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Pathfinder" style = "text-align:justify;">I'm Marvin, but my best friends call me Pathfinder. I love being an Apex Legend because that means my banner is on display for everyone 
            in the Outlands to see, especially my creator whoever they are. Competing alongside so many skilled fighters each match is really cool and it makes me very excited to know that I am everyone’s favorite squadmate to fight with; my friend Mirage told me that.
            He also said that I don’t get sarcasm, which was also nice to hear...I think.</blockquote>
